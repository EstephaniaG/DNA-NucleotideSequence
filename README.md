# DNA-NucleotideSequence

Interdisciplinary Swift program

Please note that the file DNA Demo 2 is a what I have so far for others to get an idea of how I want the program to run. DNA Demo Copy is the work in progress file that does not sucessfully run... yet.

This is an interdisplinary project that will be projected onto a painting of a nueron cell. The nuclues of the neuron cell will contain four different circles that light up and play sound. The program is reading from a txt. file that containts a sequence of the letters, TCGA. Each letter has a corresponding color and sound. The idea is to get the program to read each letter from the sequence and have each correspoinding circle light up and play sound. I am having issues with my class in my program titled nucleotide. I need to create a class in which I assign the color and sound to each object. I need to create a funciton that contains an array of sounds in which an array is added to each object. Within the array i also ned to make an audioplayer for my object to be a delegate, (this would allow for the sound to be played). Once the sound is done playing, i need to delete the audioplayer from that array so that each sound that is being played can overlap each other.

I also need to figure out how to make the color last longer in each circle when the program is reading the sequence.
